# Plan: Lenticularis — Product Spec & Implementation Brief (v2.3)

## Overview

Lenticularis is a weather aggregation and paragliding decision-support system for Switzerland. It collects data from 5 weather networks, normalises and stores it in InfluxDB, and lets each pilot build graphical per-site rule sets using a condition builder. Each condition targets a specific station — a single rule set can freely combine data from multiple stations. The system produces GREEN/ORANGE/RED decisions, stores full per-condition decision history, and exposes a statistics dashboard showing flyability patterns over time.

Core differentiator: **rules are fully pilot-owned and self-served** through a graphical editor. No admin-imposed logic.

## User Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| **Pilot (user)** | Manage own launch sites, build own rule sets, view stats, configure notifications, share/clone rule sets |
| **Admin** | Manage user accounts, enable/disable collectors and collection intervals — no involvement in rules or sites |

---

## User Stories

1. As a **pilot**, I open the map and see a traffic light for each of my launch sites.
2. As a **pilot**, I tap a launch site to see which conditions triggered the current status and why.
3. As a **pilot**, I use the rule editor to build conditions across multiple stations, e.g. Station A wind from S AND Station B wind from W both under 30 km/h → site is flyable.
4. As a **pilot**, I combine conditions with AND/OR groups and choose a combination logic.
5. As a **pilot**, I ask: "How many days was this site flyable in the last 6 months?"
6. As a **pilot**, I see which hours of the day are most often GREEN for a given site.
7. As a **pilot**, I see a seasonal/monthly flyability breakdown.
8. As a **pilot**, I see which specific rule conditions trigger RED most often, and from which station.
9. As a **pilot**, I compare flyability across two or more of my sites.
10. As a **pilot**, I find the longest consecutive GREEN windows in a past period.
11. As a **pilot**, I receive alerts when a site changes traffic light status.
12. As a **pilot**, I can publish a rule set for others to clone (not co-edit).
13. As an **admin**, I can enable/disable data sources and manage user accounts.

## Rule Editor Design

The rule editor is a **condition builder** (Zapier-style). Each condition row is fully independent — it carries its own station, field, operator, and value. A single rule set can freely combine data from any number of stations.

### Condition row fields

- **Station picker** — search/filter all active stations across all networks (per-row, not per-ruleset)
- **Station B picker** — only shown when field = `pressure_delta`
- **Field** — any available measurement: `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, `wind_direction`, `temperature`, `humidity`, `pressure`, `pressure_delta`, `precipitation`, `snow_depth`
- **Operator** — `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `=`, `between`, `not between`, `in direction range`
- **Value A / Value B** — numeric input with inferred units displayed; direction range shows a compass graphic
- **Result colour** — GREEN / ORANGE / RED

### AND/OR grouping

Conditions can be nested into AND/OR groups (minimum 1 level of nesting supported). The station picker is per-condition row — no global station selection for a rule set.

### Multi-station example (key use case)

```
AND group
  [Station A - Beatenberg]  wind_speed       <  30 km/h          → GREEN
  [Station A - Beatenberg]  wind_direction   in range  160–220°  → GREEN
  [Station B - Niesen]      wind_speed       <  30 km/h          → GREEN
  [Station B - Niesen]      wind_direction   in range  250–310°  → GREEN

Combination logic: Worst wins
→ All four pass → GREEN (flyable)
→ Any one fails → ORANGE or RED
```

### Pressure delta (Föhn detection)

A condition with field `pressure_delta` shows two station pickers. The runtime evaluator computes `|station_A.pressure - station_B.pressure|` and applies the operator/value normally.

### Combination logic

- `Worst wins` (default) — any RED → RED; any ORANGE → ORANGE; else GREEN
- `Majority vote` — most common colour wins

### Rule set metadata

`name`, `description`, `launch_site_id`, `is_public` (false by default), `clone_count` (read-only), `cloned_from_id`

## Data Models

### InfluxDB

**`weather_data`** measurement:
- Tags: `station_id`, `network`, `canton`
- Fields: `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, `wind_direction`, `temperature`, `humidity`, `pressure`, `precipitation`, `snow_depth`

**`rule_decisions`** measurement:
- Tags: `launch_site_id`, `ruleset_id`, `owner_id`
- Fields:
  - `decision` — green / orange / red
  - `condition_results` — JSON array: `[{condition_id, station_id, field, operator, value_a, value_b, actual_value, result_colour}]`
  - `blocking_conditions` — JSON array of condition IDs that voted non-GREEN
- Timestamp: evaluation time

> Storing `condition_results` per evaluation enables per-condition and per-station trigger statistics without re-querying raw weather data.

### SQLite tables

- `users` — `id`, `username`, `email`, `hashed_password`, `role`, `created_at`
- `weather_stations` — `station_id`, `name`, `network`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `elevation`, `canton`, `active`
- `launch_sites` — `id`, `name`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `owner_id` FK → users
- `rulesets` — `id`, `name`, `description`, `launch_site_id`, `owner_id`, `combination_logic`, `is_public`, `clone_count`, `cloned_from_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- `rule_conditions` — `id`, `ruleset_id`, `group_id` (nullable), `station_id`, `station_b_id` (nullable), `field`, `operator`, `value_a`, `value_b` (nullable), `result_colour`, `sort_order`
- `condition_groups` — `id`, `ruleset_id`, `parent_group_id` (nullable), `logic` (AND/OR), `sort_order`
- `notification_configs` — `id`, `user_id`, `launch_site_id`, `channel`, `config_json`, `on_transitions_json`

### Pydantic models

- `models/weather.py` — `WeatherStation`, `WeatherMeasurement`
- `models/auth.py` — `User`, `UserCreate`, `Token`
- `models/sites.py` — `LaunchSite`, `LaunchSiteCreate`
- `models/rules.py` — `RuleSet`, `RuleSetCreate`, `Condition`, `ConditionGroup`, `TrafficLightDecision`
- `models/decisions.py` — `DecisionRecord`, `ConditionResult`
- `models/stats.py` — response shapes for all 7 statistics endpoints

---

## Statistics Module

All metrics are computed from the `rule_decisions` InfluxDB measurement using Flux queries plus server-side aggregation. No raw weather re-processing needed.

### Metrics

|---|---|---|
| Flyable days | Count of calendar days with ≥1 GREEN evaluation | `GET /api/stats/{ruleset_id}/flyable-days` |
| Hourly pattern | GREEN % per hour-of-day (0–23) | `GET /api/stats/{ruleset_id}/hourly-pattern` |
| Monthly breakdown | GREEN/ORANGE/RED counts per calendar month | `GET /api/stats/{ruleset_id}/monthly` |
| Seasonal breakdown | Same grouped by meteorological season | `GET /api/stats/{ruleset_id}/seasonal` |
| Condition trigger rate | % of evaluations where each condition voted non-GREEN, attributed to station | `GET /api/stats/{ruleset_id}/condition-triggers` |

| Best windows | Top N longest consecutive GREEN streaks | `GET /api/stats/{ruleset_id}/best-windows` |

All time-range endpoints accept `?from=&to=` parameters. Best-windows also accepts `?top_n=5`.

## Implementation Steps

1. Update `.cursorrules` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with final project conventions
2. Finalise `pyproject.toml` — add `python-jose`, `passlib`, `aiosmtplib`
3. SQLite schema + Alembic migrations — all 7 tables in `database/models.py`
4. Auth system — JWT in `api/routers/auth.py`; `get_current_user` + `require_admin` dependencies
5. Config system — complete `config.py` for all 5 collectors, InfluxDB, SQLite, SMTP/Pushover
6. Collector framework — complete `collectors/base.py`; build all 5 collectors
7. Pydantic models — all 6 model files listed above
8. InfluxDB client — `database/influx.py`; write + query + `query_decisions()` helper
9. Rules evaluator — `rules/evaluator.py`; walks condition tree, fetches live data per condition (per station), applies operator logic, resolves combination logic, writes full `condition_results` to InfluxDB
10. Statistics service — `services/stats.py`; Flux queries for all 7 metrics; best-windows as server-side algorithm
11. Scheduler — `scheduler.py`; all enabled collectors + periodic evaluation of all active rulesets
12. API routers — wire all endpoints; `api/main.py` startup/shutdown lifecycle
13. Notification service — `services/notifications.py`; status-transition triggers; email + Pushover dispatch
14. Frontend — Rule Editor (`static/editor.js`): per-row station picker, field/operator/value inputs, AND/OR group nesting, pressure-delta two-station mode, direction range compass graphic, live preview panel, save
15. Frontend — Statistics Dashboard (`static/stats.js`): flyable days card, hourly heatmap, monthly bar chart, condition trigger leaderboard (with station attribution), site comparison chart, best windows list
16. Frontend — Map & Dashboard (`static/app.js`): Leaflet.js map, traffic light badges per site, weather history chart panel, community gallery page, mobile-responsive layout
17. Docker — `Dockerfile` (multi-stage), `docker-compose.yml` (app + InfluxDB), health checks, `restart: unless-stopped`, updated `README.md`

---

## Verification

- Unit tests (`pytest`): config loading, each collector's `normalize_data()`, all condition operators, pressure delta, AND/OR group logic, both combination modes, all 7 statistics metric functions with fixture data
- Integration test: create user → site → rule set with multi-station conditions → trigger evaluations → query stats endpoints → assert flyable-day count matches seeded decisions
- Manual: open rule editor, build a rule mixing Station A (wind speed) and Station B (wind direction), save, run scheduler, open stats dashboard, verify condition trigger chart attributes correctly to each station
- Community gallery: publish as user 1 → clone as user 2 → verify `clone_count` increments

---

## Key Decisions

- Rules are 100% pilot-owned; admin limited to collector config and user management
- Station picker is **per condition row** — no ruleset-level station selection — enabling multi-station rules natively
- `condition_results` JSON (including `station_id`) written per evaluation to InfluxDB enables per-station trigger statistics without raw weather re-queries
- Condition tree stored normalised in `rule_conditions` + `condition_groups` tables (not a JSON blob) for queryability
- Pressure delta is a first-class condition type with two-station picker
- Best-windows metric computed server-side (not Flux) for simplicity
- Rule sharing is clone-only (no co-editing); private by default, opt-in publish
- Chart.js for all charts (lightweight, no framework required)
- All 5 data sources in scope from v1
