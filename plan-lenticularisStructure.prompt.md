# Plan: Lenticularis — Product Spec & Implementation Brief (v2.3)

## Overview

Lenticularis is a weather aggregation and paragliding decision-support system for Switzerland. It collects data from multiple weather networks, normalises and stores it in InfluxDB, and lets each pilot build graphical per-site rule sets using a condition builder. Each condition targets a specific station — a single rule set can freely combine data from multiple stations. The system produces GREEN/ORANGE/RED decisions, stores full per-condition decision history, and exposes a statistics dashboard showing flyability patterns over time.

Core differentiator: **rules are fully pilot-owned and self-served** through a graphical editor. No admin-imposed logic.

---

## User Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| **Pilot (user)** | Manage own launch sites, build own rule sets, view stats, configure notifications, share/clone rule sets |
| **Admin** | Manage user accounts, enable/disable collectors and collection intervals — no involvement in rules or sites |

---

## User Stories

1. As a **pilot**, I open the map and see a traffic light for each of my launch sites.
2. As a **pilot**, I tap a launch site to see which conditions triggered the current status and why.
3. As a **pilot**, I use the rule editor to build conditions across multiple stations, e.g. Station A wind from S AND Station B wind from W both under 30 km/h → site is flyable.
4. As a **pilot**, I combine conditions with AND/OR groups and choose a combination logic.
5. As a **pilot**, I ask: "How many days was this site flyable in the last 6 months?"
6. As a **pilot**, I see which hours of the day are most often GREEN for a given site.
7. As a **pilot**, I see a seasonal/monthly flyability breakdown.
8. As a **pilot**, I see which specific rule conditions trigger RED most often, and from which station.
9. As a **pilot**, I compare flyability across two or more of my sites.
10. As a **pilot**, I find the longest consecutive GREEN windows in a past period.
11. As a **pilot**, I receive alerts when a site changes traffic light status.
12. As a **pilot**, I can publish a rule set for others to clone (not co-edit).
13. As an **admin**, I can enable/disable data sources and manage user accounts.

## Rule Editor Design

The rule editor is a **condition builder** (Zapier-style). Each condition row is fully independent — it carries its own station, field, operator, and value. A single rule set can freely combine data from any number of stations.

### Condition row fields

- **Station picker** — search/filter all active stations across all networks (per-row, not per-ruleset)
- **Station B picker** — only shown when field = `pressure_delta`
- **Field** — any available measurement: `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, `wind_direction`, `temperature`, `humidity`, `pressure`, `pressure_delta`, `precipitation`, `snow_depth`
- **Operator** — `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `=`, `between`, `not between`, `in direction range`
- **Value A / Value B** — numeric input with inferred units displayed; direction range shows a compass graphic
- **Result colour** — GREEN / ORANGE / RED

### AND/OR grouping

Conditions can be nested into AND/OR groups (minimum 1 level of nesting supported). The station picker is per-condition row — no global station selection for a rule set.

### Multi-station example (key use case)

```
AND group
  [Station A - Beatenberg]  wind_speed       <  30 km/h          → GREEN
  [Station A - Beatenberg]  wind_direction   in range  160–220°  → GREEN
  [Station B - Niesen]      wind_speed       <  30 km/h          → GREEN
  [Station B - Niesen]      wind_direction   in range  250–310°  → GREEN

Combination logic: Worst wins
→ All four pass → GREEN (flyable)
→ Any one fails → ORANGE or RED
```

### Pressure delta (Föhn detection)

A condition with field `pressure_delta` shows two station pickers. The runtime evaluator computes `|station_A.pressure - station_B.pressure|` and applies the operator/value normally.

### Combination logic

- `Worst wins` (default) — any RED → RED; any ORANGE → ORANGE; else GREEN
- `Majority vote` — most common colour wins

### Rule set metadata

`name`, `description`, `launch_site_id`, `is_public` (false by default), `clone_count` (read-only), `cloned_from_id`

## Data Models

### InfluxDB

**`weather_data`** measurement:
- Tags: `station_id`, `network`, `canton`
- Fields: `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, `wind_direction`, `temperature`, `humidity`, `pressure`, `precipitation`, `snow_depth`

**`rule_decisions`** measurement:
- Tags: `launch_site_id`, `ruleset_id`, `owner_id`
- Fields:
  - `decision` — green / orange / red
  - `condition_results` — JSON array: `[{condition_id, station_id, field, operator, value_a, value_b, actual_value, result_colour}]`
  - `blocking_conditions` — JSON array of condition IDs that voted non-GREEN
- Timestamp: evaluation time

> Storing `condition_results` per evaluation enables per-condition and per-station trigger statistics without re-querying raw weather data.

### SQLite tables

- `users` — `id`, `username`, `email`, `hashed_password`, `role`, `created_at`
- `weather_stations` — `station_id`, `name`, `network`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `elevation`, `canton`, `active`
- `launch_sites` — `id`, `name`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `owner_id` FK → users
- `rulesets` — `id`, `name`, `description`, `launch_site_id`, `owner_id`, `combination_logic`, `is_public`, `clone_count`, `cloned_from_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- `rule_conditions` — `id`, `ruleset_id`, `group_id` (nullable), `station_id`, `station_b_id` (nullable), `field`, `operator`, `value_a`, `value_b` (nullable), `result_colour`, `sort_order`
- `condition_groups` — `id`, `ruleset_id`, `parent_group_id` (nullable), `logic` (AND/OR), `sort_order`
- `notification_configs` — `id`, `user_id`, `launch_site_id`, `channel`, `config_json`, `on_transitions_json`

### Pydantic models

- `models/weather.py` — `WeatherStation`, `WeatherMeasurement`
- `models/auth.py` — `User`, `UserCreate`, `Token`
- `models/sites.py` — `LaunchSite`, `LaunchSiteCreate`
- `models/rules.py` — `RuleSet`, `RuleSetCreate`, `Condition`, `ConditionGroup`, `TrafficLightDecision`
- `models/decisions.py` — `DecisionRecord`, `ConditionResult`
- `models/stats.py` — response shapes for all 7 statistics endpoints

---

## Statistics Module

All metrics are computed from the `rule_decisions` InfluxDB measurement using Flux queries plus server-side aggregation. No raw weather re-processing needed.

### Metrics

| Metric | Description | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| Flyable days | Count of calendar days with ≥1 GREEN evaluation | `GET /api/stats/{ruleset_id}/flyable-days` |
| Hourly pattern | GREEN % per hour-of-day (0–23) | `GET /api/stats/{ruleset_id}/hourly-pattern` |
| Monthly breakdown | GREEN/ORANGE/RED counts per calendar month | `GET /api/stats/{ruleset_id}/monthly` |
| Seasonal breakdown | Same grouped by meteorological season | `GET /api/stats/{ruleset_id}/seasonal` |
| Condition trigger rate | % of evaluations where each condition voted non-GREEN, attributed to station | `GET /api/stats/{ruleset_id}/condition-triggers` |
| Site comparison | Flyable days side-by-side for ≥2 rulesets | `GET /api/stats/compare?ruleset_ids=1,2,3` |
| Best windows | Top N longest consecutive GREEN streaks | `GET /api/stats/{ruleset_id}/best-windows` |

All time-range endpoints accept `?from=&to=` parameters. Best-windows also accepts `?top_n=5`.

### v1.0 — Multilanguage (EN / DE / FR / IT) ✅ Shipped
Full i18n for all frontend pages and dynamic JS strings.

- **Translation files**: `static/i18n/{en,de,fr,it}.json` — flat key tree covering all UI strings
- **Core engine**: `static/i18n.js` — `initI18n()`, `t(key, vars?)`, `applyDataI18n()`, `renderLangPicker()`
- **HTML markup**: `data-i18n="key"` on all static text nodes; `data-i18n-placeholder="key"` on inputs
- **JS dynamic strings**: all popup/chart/error strings use `window.t('key')` calls
- **Language picker**: dropdown injected into nav by `renderLangPicker()`; persists to `localStorage`
- **Auto-detection**: `navigator.language` slice on first visit; falls back to `en`
- **Timing guard**: non-module scripts (e.g. `map.js`) use `typeof window.t === 'function' ? window.t : k => k` to avoid `window.t is not a function` before `initI18n()` completes
- **Lazy config**: objects whose values call `window.t()` are wrapped in getter functions (e.g. `getFieldLabel()`) rather than module-level constants, so they evaluate post-init

---

### v1.1 — Admin GUI + Role Expansion (planned)

- New role: `customer` (read-only access to assigned sites/rulesets, no rule editing) — roles: `pilot` | `customer` | `admin`
- Admin panel UI (`static/admin.html`): user table (list, activate/deactivate, change role), collector status (enabled/disabled toggle, interval override, last-run timestamp, error count)
- `api/routers/admin.py`: `GET/PUT /api/admin/users`, `GET/PUT /api/admin/collectors`
- Alembic migration: add `customer` to role enum

### v1.2 — Rule Types: Risk + Opportunity (planned)

- `RuleSet.rule_type`: `risk` (default, existing) | `opportunity`
- **Risk** (existing): conditions define limits — exceeding them → ORANGE/RED
- **Opportunity**: conditions define ideal windows — all met → separate GREEN badge
- Two independent badges per launch site on the map: safety badge (risk) + opportunity badge
- Rule editor gains rule-type toggle; condition builder UX is identical
- Evaluator writes to `rule_decisions` with tag `rule_type` = risk/opportunity

### v1.3 — Pre-seeded Launch Site Defaults (planned)

- Admin can define a default ruleset template per launch site (or a global fallback)
- New SQLite table: `site_default_rulesets` (`site_id` nullable, `ruleset_json`, `created_by_admin_id`)
- When a pilot adds a site that has a default template, the template is cloned into their account as an editable starting point
- Admin UI: Default Rules tab per site in admin panel

### v1.4 — AI-Assisted Rule Building (planned)

- Free-text input in rule editor: wind from south under 30, gusts under 40, not raining
- `POST /api/rulesets/ai-suggest` sends prompt + available station list to Claude API, returns a pre-filled condition tree JSON
- Pilot reviews and saves the suggested tree
- Requires `claude_api_key` in `config.yml`

### v1.5 — OGN Live Map Overlay + Launch Statistics (planned)

- **Live overlay**: toggleable Leaflet layer showing glider positions from OGN APRS feed
  - Backend WebSocket proxy (`/api/ogn/stream`) relays APRS messages filtered to Swiss bounding box
  - Frontend: `static/ogn.js` subscribes, places/moves glider markers
- **Launch statistics**: background job detects takeoffs from OGN tracks near known launch site coordinates
  - Takeoff heuristic: altitude gain >50 m within 500 m of site lat/lon
  - Stores daily takeoff count per site in InfluxDB `ogn_takeoffs` measurement
  - Stats dashboard: OGN launch activity vs ruleset decision chart

### v1.6 — xcontest Statistics (planned)

- Correlate xcontest.org flight dates near each site with ruleset decision history
- Rule accuracy card on `ruleset-analysis.html`: % of flight days that matched GREEN decision
- If many flights on RED days, rule may be too pessimistic

### v1.7 — Paragliding Club Area Overlay (planned)

- Map layer showing club coverage polygons from a manually-maintained GeoJSON
- Popup: club name, website, contact
- Admin UI: upload/edit club GeoJSON

### v1.8 — Duplicate Station Handling (planned)

- Admin can mark two stations as same physical location with a priority order
- Map and API surface the station with the most recent data
- Admin UI: Station aliases table

### v1.9 — VKPI / BOB Custom Pages (planned)

- White-label map view scoped to specific sites + customer role access
- Details TBD

---

## Backlog (post-v1.9, unprioritised)

- **Community Rule Gallery** — `GET /api/gallery`, `POST /api/gallery/{id}/clone`; pilots can publish rule sets for others to clone
- **Notifications** — email + Pushover alerts on ruleset status transitions
- **Additional Collectors** — Holfuy, Windline (API-key networks)
- **Wind rose chart** — replace direction scatter on station-detail with a proper wind rose
- **Performance pass** — InfluxDB query profiling, downsampling task for data older than 90 days

---

## Verification

- Unit tests (`pytest`): config loading, each collector's `normalize_data()`, all condition operators, pressure delta, AND/OR group logic, both combination modes, all 7 statistics metric functions with fixture data
- Integration test: create user → site → rule set with multi-station conditions → trigger evaluations → query stats endpoints → assert flyable-day count matches seeded decisions
- Manual: open rule editor, build a rule mixing Station A (wind speed) and Station B (wind direction), save, run scheduler, open stats dashboard, verify condition trigger chart attributes correctly to each station
- Community gallery: publish as user 1 → clone as user 2 → verify `clone_count` increments

---

## Key Decisions

- Rules are 100% pilot-owned; admin limited to collector config and user management
- Station picker is **per condition row** — no ruleset-level station selection — enabling multi-station rules natively
- `condition_results` JSON (including `station_id`) written per evaluation to InfluxDB enables per-station trigger statistics without raw weather re-queries
- Condition tree stored normalised in `rule_conditions` + `condition_groups` tables (not a JSON blob) for queryability
- Pressure delta is a first-class condition type with two-station picker
- Best-windows metric computed server-side (not Flux) for simplicity
- Rule sharing is clone-only (no co-editing); private by default, opt-in publish
- Chart.js for all charts (lightweight, no framework required)
- MeteoSwiss, SLF, and METAR are the primary no-auth collectors; Holfuy, Windline, and Ecovitt are deferred to v1.2
